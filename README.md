# My Go Learning Journey 🚀
Welcome to my repository documenting my exploration of Go! This is a collection of small projects designed to help me build skills step by step.

---

## 📚 Overview
- **Why Go?**: I'm drawn to Go for its simplicity and suitability for backend development.
- **Goal**: To complete a series of projects, each focusing on different aspects of Go. There is no "bar" for what makes a 'good' project, so there might be extremely simplistic projects in this repository.

## 🌟 Highlights
### 12132024
- So far, Go seems to take a bit from other languages I'm familiar with already. For instance, the use of Makefile's to build projects as well as the general syntax reminds me a bit of C and Python.
